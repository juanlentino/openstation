/**
 * OpenStation — Widget layer.
 *
 * Owns the right-side `#os-widgets` column + the floating
 * overlay for widgets the user has liberated via drag. Responsibilities:
 *
 *   - Load the enabled-id list + floating-widget geometry from
 *     localStorage on boot
 *   - Mount each enabled widget, choosing column-docked vs floating
 *     based on the widget def (`movable`) + persisted state
 *   - Render the trailing `+` tile that opens the picker
 *   - Handle card remove + liberate-on-drag transitions
 *   - Persist changes back to localStorage (+ fire add/remove actions)
 *
 * Drag + resize pointer logic lives in {@link ./frame.ts}; persistence
 * in {@link ./state.ts}. This file is orchestration only so the
 * mental model of each module stays narrow.
 *
 * Widgets paint above the wallpaper (z-index: 1) but under windows
 * (which start at z-index 100). The column never intercepts window
 * drag / resize — only its own cards + `+` button are interactive,
 * everything else passes through.
